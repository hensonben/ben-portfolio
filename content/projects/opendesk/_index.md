+++

## Overview  

**OpenDesk** is a web-based tool designed to help students at the University of Pittsburgh quickly find open classrooms to study in. Instead of walking through multiple floors of Hillman Library or the Cathedral of Learning in search of an empty room, users can simply select a building and view which classrooms are currently available in real time.  

The project was built for **SteelHacks XII** and combines data scraping, backend development, and frontend design to deliver a seamless experience. By leveraging classroom scheduling data from **25Live**, OpenDesk simplifies one of the most common student frustrations—finding a quiet study spot on campus.

## My Contributions  

As part of a four-person team, I focused on the **data engineering and backend integration** of the project:  

- Developed a **Python script** to scrape 25Live scheduling data and convert **ICS files into JSON**, normalizing classroom schedules across **30+ buildings** and **250+ classrooms**.  
- Implemented a data pipeline to automatically organize and clean room availability information for use by the frontend.  
- Used **Matplotlib** to generate building-level **heatmaps** and performance metrics, including peak hours and room utilization percentages.  
- Collaborated closely with teammates handling the **React + Flask** frontend to ensure smooth communication between the backend data and the user interface.  

OpenDesk not only gave me hands-on experience with web development and data integration, but also reinforced the value of collaboration in transforming complex raw data into something genuinely useful for students.
