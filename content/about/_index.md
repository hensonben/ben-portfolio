title = "About Me"
+++

I’m **Benjamin Henson**, a Data Science student at the University of Pittsburgh.

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by how things work, a curiosity that has carried into nearly everything I do today. Whether I’m exploring the fundamentals of natural language processing or figuring out how to build and host my own website (like this one), I approach each challenge with an open mind and a genuine desire to learn.
## Further
I've always disliked Platforms like **LinkedIn**, which has always felt a bit sterile and competitive to me, more like résumés on display than reflections of people who genuinely love what they do.

This site is an acceptable alternative for myself. It’s where I’ll share projects relating to Data Science, along with any other particular interests I choose to share.
## How It Works
This site is built with **Hugo**, a lightweight static site generator, and **self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5** sitting right next to my desk.  

I designed it as both a personal portfolio and a learning project — a way to explore automation, web development, and the technical side of maintaining a live site.
